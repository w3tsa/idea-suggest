This app uses firebase as the Database, Authentication & hosting. For UI I have used VUE js instance.
This app could be modified in order to get idea/tutorial/feature etc requests from the team.
One Caveat since it is a firebase app, and uses firebase funtion it is slower for the first time.

Authentication:
user: eamil1@email.com
pass: test123456
